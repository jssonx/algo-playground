#
# Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing
# order, and an integer k.
# 
# Return the k^th positive integer that is missing from this array.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
# Output: 9
# Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The
# 5^thÂ missing positive integer is 9.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2^nd missing
# positive integer is 6.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= k <= 1000
# arr[i] < arr[j] for 1 <= i < j <= arr.length
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up:
# 
# Could you solve this problem in less than O(n) complexity?

            if missing_num_left >= k:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid
        # res = arr[left] + (k - (arr[left] - left - 1))
        res = k + left + 1
