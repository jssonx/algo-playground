#
# Given the head of a linkedÂ list, rotate the list to the right by k places.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
# Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
# Output: [2,0,1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 0 <= k <= 2 * 10^9
#
