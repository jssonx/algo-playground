#
# Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three
# integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
# 
# Return the sum of the three integers.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 3 <= nums.length <= 500
# -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
#
